# Arithmic Logic Unit 
is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.

## Operations
1. Arithmetic Addition : ALU_Out = A + B;
2. Arithmetic Subtraction : ALU_Out = A - B;
3. Arithmetic Multiplication: ALU_Out = A * B;
4. Arithmetic Division : ALU_Out = A / B;
5. Logical Shift Left : ALU_Out = A logical shifted left by 1;
6. Logical Shift Right : ALU_Out = A logical shifted right by 1;
7. Rotate Left : ALU_Out = A rotated left by 1;
8. Rotate Right : ALU_Out = A rotated right by 1;
9. Logical AND : ALU_Out = A AND B;
10. Logical OR : ALU_Out = A OR B;
11. Logical XOR : ALU_Out = A XOR B;
12. Logical NOR : ALU_Out = A NOR B;
13. Logical NAND : ALU_Out = A NAND B;
14. Logical XNOR : ALU_Out = A XNOR B;
15. Greater comparison : ALU_Out = 1 if A > B else 0;
16. Equal comparison : ALU_Out = 1 A = B else 0;
